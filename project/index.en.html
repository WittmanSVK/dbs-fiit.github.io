            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>
              Create a database application in an environment of your choice, which <b>addresses at least 6 use case scenarios in their full complexity</b> according to dmain of your choice. Exact scope and detailed description of selected scenarios is to be consulted and confirmed by your TA during lab sessions. You will create the application in two iterations. In the first one, you will be using relational database and provide implementation of following generic scenarios:
		<ul>
			<li>Creation of a new record,</li>
			<li>Update of an existing record,</li>
			<li>Deletion of a record,</li>
			<li>Display of an overview of several records (along with a selected basic statistics),</li>
			<li>Display of a record detail,</li>
			<li>Filtering of records according user-provided criteria.</li>
		</ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Application can have a console or graphical user interface. Essential is that chosen scenarios are realized "for real", i.e., application must provide the functionality in a way, which would be expected by a customer in given domain.</p>

	    <p>
              Scenarions, which are altering the data, must be realized <b>using transactions</b> and at least one of them must <b>work with multiple tables</b> (typically record creation and foreign key binding).
            </p>

            <p>In secord iteration, you will add at least one additional scenario into the application, which will be based on using non=relational database <a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> (or any other non-relational database, if agreed upon with your TA). Detailed description of the scenario is to be consulted and confirmed by your TA, depending on chosen database and your application domain (e.g., statistics on interaction with individual records using Redis or advanced search within records using Elasticsearch).

            <p>You need to have first iteration submitted and accepted to be eligible for submission of second iteration.</p>

            <p>You need to have both iterations submitted and accepted to be eligible for final exam.</p>

            <h3>What to submit and when</h3>
	    <p>Milestones which require submission into AIS can be delayed for maximum of 2 days, with penalization of 1/3 of points for each started day of delay (i.e., a student gets 2/3 of points on a day after the deadline and 1/3 of points when submitted on a second day following the deadline). Later submission is not permitted. Failure to submit a project iteration automatically implies failure of the whole couse.</p>
